# Continuous Similar Trajectory Search on AIS Data
## Abstract 
Trajectory similarity search has attracted significant attention, especially in applications like transportation, maritime navigation, and traffic monitoring, where identifying patterns in movement is critical. Existing approaches typically focus on finding similarities between entire trajectories using retrospective analysis. However, these methods become less effective when applied to real-time scenarios, where continuous and evolving trajectory comparisons are required as new data is constantly generated. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing a real-time Continuous Similarity Trajectory Search (CSTS) method specifically designed for vessel trajectories using AIS data. Our system introduces a novel similarity measure, Object-Trajectory Real-time Distance (OTRD), that places greater emphasis on the future trend of moving objects, allowing for more predictive and forward-looking comparisons. To optimize performance, we develop an index structure, Segment-based Vessel Trajectory Index (SVTI), that organizes historical trajectories into smaller, manageable segments, facilitating faster and more efficient similarity calculations. Additionally, we implement a variety of pruning strategies to reduce unnecessary computations during the similarity calculation and the continuous search process, further improving the system's scalability and responsiveness. Through extensive experimental evaluations using real-world AIS data, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing solutions in both efficiency and effectiveness. These results make our solution highly suitable for real-time applications such as maritime traffic monitoring, collision avoidance, and route optimization, providing a robust framework for dynamic, large-scale vessel trajectory analysis.
